Script to generate a slab of pure FCC Ni.  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Script to generate a slab of pure FCC Ni. 

The structure is oriented such that the xy plane is parallel to the \{111\} crystalographic plane, where the x-\/axis is parallel to \mbox{[}1-\/10\mbox{]}, the y-\/axis is parallel to \mbox{[}11-\/2\mbox{]}, and the z-\/axis is parallel to \mbox{[}111\mbox{]}.

The cell dimensions can be changed to generate slabs of different sizes.

The output structure is written to a .data file, which can then be read be used as an input to LAMMPS.

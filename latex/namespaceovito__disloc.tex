Post-\/proceesing of dislocation MD trajectories.  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Post-\/proceesing of dislocation MD trajectories. 

This script reads in a series of LAMMPS dump files containing unwrapped atom coordinates and uses OVITO\textquotesingle{}s Dislocation Analysis (DXA) tool to detect edge dislocations. The script outputs a series of text files (one for each frame in the trajectory) containing the following\+: the number of dislocations detected; the dislocation index; the number of vertices in a detected dislocation line; the x, y, and z cooridnates of each vertex.

The dislocations are not consistently indexed across the trajectory, which makes it difficult to track a given dislocation and analyse it. This is taken care of in the script \doxylink{dislocation__script_8py}{dislocation\+\_\+script.\+py}, which reads in and processes the text files generated by this script and outputs a given dislocation\textquotesingle{}s position as a timeseries for further analysis.

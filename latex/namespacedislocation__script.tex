Dislocation trajectory post-\/processing script.  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Dislocation trajectory post-\/processing script. 

This script demonstrates how the output of the OVITO DXA tool, which is used in \doxylink{ovito__disloc_8py}{ovito\+\_\+disloc.\+py}, can be post-\/processed to "{}track"{} these dislocations throughout the trajectory. The script \doxylink{ovito__disloc_8py}{ovito\+\_\+disloc.\+py} uses DXA to detect dislocations in Molecular Dynamics (MD) trajectories and outputs the coordinates of the vertices of each detected dislocation line. However, the OVITO DXA tool does not index detected dislocations consistently across frames i.\+e. one dislocation can be indexed as dislocation 0 in one frame and dislocation 1 in a different frame. This makes it difficult to follow or "{}track"{} a specific dislocation across a trajectory for further analysis, such as studying its dynamics.

This script shows how this can be overcome by using the tools contained in \doxylink{dislocation__analysis_8py}{dislocation\+\_\+analysis.\+py} to extract trajectories (position vs. time data) for each distinct dislocation detected by OVITOS\textquotesingle{} DXA. This script takes as input text files containing the output from DXA in the format described in the documentation of \doxylink{ovito__disloc_8py}{ovito\+\_\+disloc.\+py}.

This script is used to analyse an MD simulation of an a/2\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}110\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\{111\} edge dislocation in pure Ni. This dislocation dissociates into two partial dislocations. The scripts \doxylink{lmp__pre__strain_8py}{lmp\+\_\+pre\+\_\+strain.\+py}, \doxylink{gen__1disloc__Ni_8py}{gen\+\_\+1disloc\+\_\+\+Ni.\+py}, and \doxylink{gen__111__atoms_8py}{gen\+\_\+111\+\_\+atoms.\+py} can be used to create the structure and run the MD simulation.

This script can be used to analyse trajectories containing any number of dislocations (or partial dislocations), given the following assumptions\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The dislocations are straight, edge dislocations.
\item The dislocations only move in the x direction.
\item The number of dislocations is constant across all frames i.\+e. no dislocations are generated nor lost throughout the analysed trajectory.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Some plotting code is provided at the end of the script to illustrate its output. Two figures are generated each showing the average x-\/position vs. time and x-\/velocity vs. time plots for the\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Partial disocations.
\item Perfect dislocation (the average of the two partials)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
